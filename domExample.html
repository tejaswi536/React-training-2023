    <!-- Including the script at the end, allowing HTML to be fully parsed first -->

    <!-- 
    Placing scripts at the end of the body can prevent potential errors like "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')".
    This is because, if the script manipulates the DOM and relies on elements that should be in the HTML body,
    ensuring the script runs after the HTML document is fully loaded is crucial. 
    You can use the DOMContentLoaded event or place the script just before the closing body tag to achieve this.

  <h2 id="mainHeading">What is DOM?</h2>
  <p class="paragraph" id="mainParagraph">The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is like a tree-like structure that represents a webpage. Each part of the page, like paragraphs, images, and buttons, is a "node" in this tree. You can use JavaScript to interact with and change these nodes. For example, you can add new content to a webpage, change the text in a paragraph, or make a button do something when clicked. The DOM helps JavaScript talk to and control the elements on a webpage.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Modifying HTML using the DOM (Document Object Model)</p>
  <p>console.log(document) and console.log(window) are both logging objects, but they represent different things in the context of a web browser.</p>
<p>
    <b>console.log(document):</b>
    The document object represents the entire HTML document.
    It is part of the DOM (Document Object Model) and provides an interface to interact with the content and structure of the document.
    You can use document to access elements, modify content, update styles, and perform various operations on the document itself.
  </p><p>
    <b>console.log(window):</b>
    The window object is the global object in a browser environment.
    It represents the browser window or tab and encompasses the entire browsing context.
    window includes properties and methods that relate to the browser environment, such as handling events, opening new windows, and setting timeouts.</p>
