  <h2>Array Methods in Java script</h2>
  <p>JavaScript provides several built-in methods that can be used
  to perform various operations on arrays. Here are some commonly used
  array methods in JavaScript:</p>
  <h4>Mutator Methods (Modify the original array):</h4>

  <p>push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.</p>
  <p>pop(): Removes the last element from an array.</p>
  <p>shift(): Removes the first element from an array.</p>
  <p>unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.</p>
  <p>splice(): Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.</p>
  <p>reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in an array.</p>
  <p>sort(): Sorts the elements of an array.</p>
  
  <h4>Accessor Methods (Do not modify the original array):</h4>
  
  <p>concat(): Returns a new array that combines the elements of two or more arrays.</p>
  <p>slice(): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.</p>
  <p>indexOf(): Returns the first index at which a given element is found.</p>
  <p>lastIndexOf(): Returns the last index at which a given element is found.</p>
  <p>includes(): Determines whether an array includes a certain element.</p>
  
  <h4>Iteration Methods:</h4>
  
  <p>forEach(): Calls a function for each element in the array.</p>
  <p>map(): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.</p>
  <p>filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.</p>
  <p>reduce(): Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.</p>
  <p>every(): Tests whether all elements in the array pass the provided function.</p>
  <p>some(): Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the provided function.</p>
  
  <h4>Iteration and Transformation Methods (Do not modify the original array):</h4>
  
  <p>find(): Returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.</p>
  <p>findIndex(): Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.</p>
