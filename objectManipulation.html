  <h2>Object Manipulation in Java script</h2>
  <p>Objects and arrays are reference types in programming, 
    meaning they store references or addresses to memory locations where data is stored.
    Object:An object is a complex data type that allows you to store key-value pairs. 
    Each key (also called a property) is associated with a value.
    </p><p>example : let person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "Example City"
    };
    </p>
    <p>Note: In summary, objects and arrays are used to organize and 
      structure data in more complex ways than primitive types. Objects use named properties, 
      while arrays use numeric indices to access their elements. Both objects and arrays are dynamic,
       meaning their size can change during runtime by adding or removing elements or properties.</p>
